<h1>This Is My First Article</h2>
<p>Hey, everyone this is Aditi Gupta. This is my first article.</p>
<p>I have created this article using HTML and CSS.
HTML is a wonderful and an interesting language. I have a deep interest in HTML.</p>
<p>I love playing around with CSS, using diffferent colors, different fonts, giving backgrounds, borders, margins, paddings etc to the text.
I have starting learning both of these languages and I want to create nice webpages with them.</p>
<p>So, this was my first article using HTML and CSS.I can also say it was my first step towards HTML and CSS.

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hey everyone!! I am Aditi, I am currently pursuing my B.Tech. I have completed first year of my graduation.</p>
<p> I have enjoyed a lot my first year in college. I have made few good friends, learnt new things, joined clubs, bunked lectures, copied assignments, etc.</p>
<p> There are many things that I have done first time in my life after coming to college. I started sketching after coming to college.
 It was the first time I had sketched some real faces on paper.</p>
 <p> Some of the sketches turned out to be quite good. Sketching became my new hobby. </p>
